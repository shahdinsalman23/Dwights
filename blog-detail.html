							<h2>The 360 Review and Other Forms of Assessment </h2>
							<span>What could go wrong?</span>
							<h5>Last Modified: 09/24/2023 01:53:31 </h5>
							<p>At the organization where I was employed, we had an employee review process that was
								exceptionally transparent and fair. This approach ensured an equitable evaluation of
								all personnel, irrespective of their roles or performance levels. It wasn't uncommon
								to witness a whirl of conversations around the office, with employees discussing
								their upcoming reviews either with a sense of trepidation or strategizing their
								approach in an almost Machiavellian manner.</p>
							<p>This review procedure was known as the 360-degree review process (360). Its moniker
								was inspired by the complete circular perspective it provided, akin to the 360
								degrees in a full circle. The naming choice was both meaningful and indicative of
								what it truly means "What goes around, comes around.</p>
							<p>The cornerstone of its effectiveness lay in its all-encompassing nature. Under this
								process, everyone from managers to individual contributors were subjected to a
								comprehensive evaluation. The most remarkable aspect of this approach was its
								capability to uncover sub-par managers. Since reviews were not limited to being
								top-down, managers found themselves being scrutinized by their peers and
								subordinates alike. This multiplicity of viewpoints often brought to light any
								managerial deficiencies, contributing to an overall improvement in the
								organization's functioning</p>
							<p>Now, this really sounds great doesn't it? An inherently fair, transparent and ideal
								process that ultimately fosters growth, accountability and continual improvement.
								Well it can be but let't elaborate a bit more.</p>
							<p>The 360 involves collecting performance feedback from all around an employee, such as
								their superiors, subordinates, colleagues, and sometimes even clients or customers.
								While it can be a valuable tool for development when implemented correctly, there
								can be several issues associated with this approach: </p>
							<p>Bias and subjectivity: Reviews can be heavily influenced by personal bias. Personal
								likes, dislikes, or other subjective feelings towards the employee being reviewed can
								affect the objectivity and reliability of the feedback.</p>
							<p>Lack of anonymity: If not properly designed, the 360-degree review process can make it
								hard to maintain reviewer anonymity, leading reviewers to give more positive reviews out
								of fear of retaliation or negative personal relations.</p>
							<p>Overwhelming feedback: The sheer volume of feedback from multiple sources can be
								overwhelming and confusing, making it difficult to interpret and action.</p>
							<p>Time-consuming: The process can be time-consuming for both the reviewers and the person
								coordinating the review, as it requires gathering and consolidating feedback from
								multiple sources.</p>
							<p>Lack of actionable feedback: Often, the feedback provided may not be specific or
								constructive enough to help the individual improve their performance.</p>
							<p>Inconsistency in evaluations: Different people may have different standards and
								expectations, leading to inconsistent evaluations.
								Potential for gaming the system: If the review process is tied to promotions or pay
								increases, people might be tempted to manipulate the system, either by providing unduly
								positive feedback for friends or harsh feedback for perceived competitors.</p>
							<p>Ill-equipped reviewers: Not all reviewers may be equipped to provide constructive,
								actionable feedback, which can result in poor quality evaluations.</p>
							<p>Despite these potential challenges, many organizations find value in the 360-degree
								review process when it is properly structured, the feedback is handled with care, and
								it's used as a tool for development rather than punishment.</p>
							<p>While the 360-degree review process is one way to gather feedback, there are several
								other approaches to performance evaluation and employee development. Here are a few:</p>
							<p>Upward Feedback: Instead of feedback from all angles, this focuses on feedback from
								subordinates to their managers. This can provide managers with insights into their
								leadership style and team management.</p>
							<p>Management by Objectives (MBO): This is a goal-oriented performance appraisal method
								where managers and employees set specific, measurable goals together for a given period,
								and then assess performance based on whether those goals have been met.</p>
							<p>Regular One-on-One Meetings: Regular meetings between employees and their immediate
								supervisors can provide opportunities for ongoing, real-time feedback. These meetings
								can be more focused, timely, and pertinent to the individual's role.</p>
							<p>Peer Reviews: In this model, employees are evaluated by their peers on several
								parameters. This type of review can be particularly effective in a team-based structure.
							</p>
							<p>Self-Evaluations: Employees assess their own performance. This method encourages
								self-reflection and personal development, but it may not be as objective.</p>
							<p>Rating Scale Method: This method uses a standard rating scale for each performance
								indicator, such as job skills and knowledge, quality of work, productivity, etc.</p>
							<p>360-Degree Feedback with Coaching: To overcome some of the drawbacks of the 360-degree
								feedback system, it can be combined with coaching. A coach can help interpret and
								prioritize the feedback, and guide the individual on how to respond to it
								constructively.</p>
							<p>Continuous Feedback Model: In this model, feedback is given on a continuous, often
								real-time basis, rather than in a formal, annual review. This approach is becoming more
								popular as it allows for quicker adjustments and more timely recognition.</p>
							<p>Each of these alternatives has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between
								them should be based on the specific needs and culture of the organization. None are
								perfect and in most cases the 360 does provide a very good assessment of one's abilities
								but it can also be a double edged sword.</p>
